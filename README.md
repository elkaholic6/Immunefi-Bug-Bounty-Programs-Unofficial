# Immunefi Bug Bounty Programs (Unofficial)
Every time a Bug Bounty Program in Immunefi modifies its **policy**, **assets-in-scope**, or **bounties-table**, a bot will commit those changes to this repo.

To get a before/after diff of a project go to `./project/{project-name}.json` and check it's latest commit.

## If a program is removed from Immunefi, will it be removed from here as well?
No, the information and history of changes will stay here forever.

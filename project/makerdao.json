      "programOverview": "MakerDAO is one of the first DeFi protocols in the crypto space that introduced the first crypto-backed stablecoin called Dai (DAI), which is set at a value of 1:1 with the United States Dollar. It is governed by those who hold and/or are delegated MKR, the governance token of the protocol. Since 2021, the project has become more decentralized, with the MakerDAO Foundation being shut down in order to move operations to decentralized business units known as core units. \n\nOne of these core units is the Immunefi Security (IS-001) core unit, a result of two decentralized organizations collaborating together. One mandate of this core unit is to launch a bug bounty program to protect the critical infrastructure of the ecosystem.\n\nFor more information about MakerDAO, please visit [https://makerdao.com/](https://makerdao.com/). \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nMakerDAO adheres to __category 3__. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nMakerDAO adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\nGovernance-Run Program\n\n__Governance-Run Program__\n\nThis bug bounty program is governed by a governance proposal. To view the governance proposal poll, visit [https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP64](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP64).\n\nAll Critical and High bug reports will have a postmortem written by the Immunefi Security core unit to be published on the Immunefi Medium blog and distributed on its social media channels after the payout is made and the fixes finalized. The identity of the bug reporter may be included, either with their real name or pseudonymously, if they choose to, or they can choose to remain anonymous.\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "__Impacts in Scope__\n\nOnly the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts/Blockchain__\n\n__Critical__\n  - Any governance voting result manipulation\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Miner-extractable value (MEV)\n  - Protocol Insolvency\n\n__High__\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for at least five blocks\n\n__Medium__\n  - Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds \n  - Block stuffing for profit\n  - Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)\n  - Theft of gas\n  - Unbounded gas consumption \n\n__Low__\n  - Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn’t lose value\n\n__Web/App__\n\n__Critical__\n\n  - Execute arbitrary system commands\n  - Retrieve sensitive data/files from a running server such as /etc/shadow, database passwords, and blockchain keys(this does not include non-sensitive environment variables, open source code, or usernames)\n  - Taking down the application/website\n  - Taking state-modifying authenticated actions (with or without blockchain state interaction) on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user, such as, changing registration information, commenting, voting, making trades, withdrawals, etc.\n  - Subdomain takeover with already-connected wallet interaction\n  - Direct theft of user funds\n  - Malicious interactions with an already-connected wallet such as modifying transaction arguments or parameters, substituting contract addresses, submitting malicious transactions \n\n__High__\n\n  - Injecting/modifying the static content on the target application without Javascript (Persistent) such as HTML injection without Javascript, replacing existing text with arbitrary text, arbitrary file uploads, etc.\n  - Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) without already-connected wallet interaction and with up to one click of user interaction, such as email or password of the victim, etc.\n  - Improperly disclosing confidential user information such as email address, phone number, physical address, etc.\n  - Subdomain takeover without already-connected wallet interaction\n\n__Medium__\n  - Changing non-sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) without already-connected wallet interaction and with up to one click of user interaction, such as changing the first/last name of user, or enabling/disabling notifications\n  - Injecting/modifying the static content on the target application without Javascript (Reflected) such as reflected HTML injection or loading external site data\n  - Redirecting users to malicious websites (Open Redirect)\n",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below.\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 10 000 000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 150 000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 100 000__, only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds involving an attack that does not require any user action at all. An impact of minting tokens on-chain beyond intended activity without requiring any user action would also be rewarded this amount due to the undesired dilution of existing circulating tokens. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical, or an impact resulting in a theft of funds that does not fall under this definition, would be rewarded __USD 50 000__.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack is considered if the smart contracts where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 300 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at 600 blocks and then a third at 900 blocks, the funds at risk would be counted at 50% and 25% of the reward from the first attack, respectively.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities will be further capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles for every additional 5 blocks that the funds or NFTs could be temporarily frozen, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5, up to the hard cap of __USD 100 000__. \n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward:\n\n  - Compensated team members of any MakerDAO core unit\n  - Employees and team members of third-party suppliers to core units that operate in a technical capacity and have assets covered in this bug bounty program\n  - Members of IS-001\n  - Third party suppliers of IS-001\n  - Team members and third-party suppliers of businesses and organizations that are not a MakerDAO core unit but have assets considered as critical infrastructure covered under the bug bounty program\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n\n  - Considering MCD_ETH - The steward core unit is aware that the balance of the contract may be different than the total amount that is deposited if users send ETH directly to the contract. They do not believe this has a negative impact on the system and so unless a report can show how having a higher balance does have negative consequences we will consider reports on the actual balance being higher than the sum of balanceOf values out of scope.\n\n  - Considering all adapters -  The steward core unit is aware that the balance (ETH or token) of the contract may be different than the total amount that is joined through the contract if users send tokens or ETH directly to the contract. They do not believe this has a negative impact on the system and so unless a report can show how having a higher balance does have negative consequences they will consider reports on the actual balance being higher than the sum of tokens 'join'ed out of scope.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nMakerDAO has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n  - [https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/maker-protocol-liquidations-2-0/](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/maker-protocol-liquidations-2-0/)  \n  - [https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-g-uni-lp-oracle/](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-g-uni-lp-oracle/) (narrowly scoped subsystem)\n  - [https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-direct-deposit-module-d3m/](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-direct-deposit-module-d3m/) \n  - h[ttps://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-optimism-dai-bridge/](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-optimism-dai-bridge/) \n  - [StarkNet DAI Bridge audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1StG_v4qmV6EJjJDD-p7O11Ql3Dmrtfew/view?usp=share_link)\n  - [StarkNet Teleport audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1113PnxOz2IjsQih0tMkVW_raWcum0ZgU/view?usp=share_link) \n  - [Direct Deposit V2 audit](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-direct-deposit/blob/master/audits/ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Direct_Deposit_V2_audit.pdf)\n  - [https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-dss-charter-smart-contracts/](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-dss-charter-smart-contracts/) \n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nBug reports that require an attack that involve one or more other protocols (e.g. utilizing flash loans from a margin protocol or manipulating the spot prices on a DEX), either to make an attack more severe than it would be in isolation, or to achieve an attack that would otherwise be impossible or infeasible, would be out-of-scope. However, they will be considered as in-scope and categorized according to the program rules as long as all of the following are true:\n\n  - Losses or other negative effects of the attack are inflicted upon Maker ecosystem participants—MKR holders, DAI holders, Vault holders, or Keepers.\n  - The losses or other negative effects could be prevented via changes to the MCD smart contracts already included in the bounty scope.\n  - The additional protocols used must have enough liquidity in various assets to allow the attack to succeed at the time of bug report submission. For example: if an attack requires an ETH flash loan, but the amount is larger than all the ETH available for loan across the ecosystem\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n\n  - Smart Contract - Critical \n  - Smart Contract - High\n  - Smart Contract - Medium\n  - Smart Contract - Low\n  - Web/App - Critical\n  - Web/App - High\n  - Web/App - Medium\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\nExceptions to the PoC requirement for smart contract bugs may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists. However, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time. \nA manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote would also qualify for a reward of __USD 100 000__. \n\nVulnerabilities that are exploitable in old versions of smart contracts and have since been mitigated (either deliberately or accidentally) in current versions (as demonstrated by the listing at [https://chainlog.makerdao.com/](https://chainlog.makerdao.com/)) are not in-scope for the bug bounty program. In the event that a vulnerability exists on the GitHub file but not on the most recently deployed contract, this may be due to a “dark spell” to fix a vulnerability quietly. If your bug report is rejected as a known issue due to this, details will be provided to you.\n\nIn order to be eligible for a reward, the vulnerability must exist both in the deployed smart contract and the GitHub file in the Assets in Scope table.\n\n[https://chainlog.makerdao.com/](https://chainlog.makerdao.com/) is designed to be easy to run locally. Hence, taking down the application/website is considered out-of-scope for this asset.\n\nAll Medium and High level bug reports are not in-scope for the [https://vote.makerdao.com/](https://vote.makerdao.com/) asset. Only Critical severity reports are in-scope for this asset.\n\nVote comments are stored in a database accessed by [https://vote.makerdao.com/](https://vote.makerdao.com/). The critical functionality of the site (e.g., voting) is in-scope, but non-critical voter comments are out-of-scope.\n\nIf you discover a vulnerability with Critical impact on any deployed smart contract, you may submit it for consideration by the Immunefi Security core unit.\n\nThe dai.js repo ([https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js/](https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js/)) is NOT in scope even though it's a dependency of the Governance Portal ([https://vote.makerdao.com/](https://vote.makerdao.com/)).\n\nFor the High impact “Causing the ESM to fail at preventing the theft or permanent locking of funds when triggered, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__. If a successful governance attack is required as part of the exploit then the reward will lean toward __USD 5 000__.\n\nWith regards to the terms under “Feasibility Limitations”, consideration may be made if the first two bullet points are met but the third isn’t, pending confirmation from the steward core unit.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the __MakerDAO__ governance with coordination by the __Immunefi Security core unit__ and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in DAI assuming a full 1:1 ratio with the USD. However, if the price of DAI deviates from the USD value by more than 1%, the amount of __DAI__ will be adjusted. As per MIP64, for bug bounty rewards over USD 1 000 000, after the first million is paid out, the remaining amount is paid out over time with up to __USD 1 000 000__ per consecutive month until the determined amount for payout is reached.\n\nDue to the limitations of the MakerDAO governance, payouts will have a delay of up to 1 calendar month after the date of validation of the bug report.",

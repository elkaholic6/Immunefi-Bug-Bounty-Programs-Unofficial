This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 5% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__. \n\nAll other rewards for the Ankr bug bounty program are scaled based on an internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in-place. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 1 000__ for each severity level, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities marked in [https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/extra/audit-reports/](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/extra/audit-reports/) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by the Ankr team directly and are denominated in USD.

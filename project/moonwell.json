All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts/Blockchain__\n\n  - Loss of user funds by permanent freezing or direct theft\n  - Loss of governance funds\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 1 hour\n  - Inability to call smart contract\n  - Smart contract gas drainage\n  - Smart contract emissions manipulation vulnerabilities\n  - Governance vote manipulation\n  - Incorrect polling actions or sequence\n\n__Web/App__\n\n  - Denial of service for the website or access mechanisms to the Moonwell Protocol\n  - DNS, routing, or proxy hijacking issues\n  - Defacement or content manipulation vulnerabilities (including XSS or clickjacking where a user can be tricked into a loss-of-funds event)\n  - Unpatched and vulnerable software running the Moonwell infrastructure (3rd party providers are out of scope) which can be abused to manipulate content\n  - Any other issues allowing an attacker to manipulate content on moonwell.fi leading to a user losing funds or interacting with malicious contracts inadvertently",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. For smart contract bug reports, at the discretion of the team, a PoC may be required in order to determine if the bug exists, and if necessary, to calculate the extent of the damage the bug could have if exploited.\n\nThe payout for smart contract vulnerabilities is dependent on the amount of funds at risk due to the vulnerability, which will be determined by the maximum value of funds at risk in the contract(s) that are impacted on the date of submission of the report.\n\nThe following ratio will apply to the payouts for smart contract vulnerabilities, based on the maximum value at risk on the date of submission:\n  - Less than $5,000,000 - 10%\n  - Between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 - 25%\n  - Between $10,000,000 and $50,000,000 - 50%\n  - Between $50,000,000 and $250,000,000 - 75%\n  - Above $250,000,000 - 100%\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. An invoice is required for payment to be made.\n\nThe Lunar Technology Foundation requires KYC to be completed by all researchers submitting a report before a bounty can be paid. The information needed is an ID scan along with a selfie to verify identity.\n\nAll known issues previously highlighted in the following audit report is considered out of scope: \n  - [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Moonwell_Finance_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf ](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Moonwell_Finance_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf)\n\nThe following are known issues and therefore are out of scope:\n\n  - Borrowing rewards for markets where a reward speed is not set do not accrue without a user calling claim (or someone calling claimBehalf).\n  - When setting reward speed = 0 and turning it back on for a market, rewards will accrue as if the new rate was always on.\n  - Assets which are supplied which a user hasn’t called ‘enterMarkets’ for can still be seized. This is working as designed.\n  - New markets must be added with no collateral factor, and some small amount of the collateral token supply must be burned in order to avoid market manipulation. This is a known issue.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Moonwell__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts will be done in __USDC__ or __USDT__, at the discretion of the team. ",

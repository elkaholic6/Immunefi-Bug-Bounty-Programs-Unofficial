Astar Network is the leading smart contract hub that connects the Polkadot ecosystem to Ethereum, Cosmos, and all major layer 1 blockchains. Astar Network supports dApps using multiple virtual machines—namely WASM and EVM—and offers the best technology solutions and financial incentives via its Build2Earn and Astar Incubation Program  ** for Web3 developers to build on top of a secure, scalable and interoperable blockchain.\n\nFor more information about Astar, please visit [https://astar.network/](https://astar.network/).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All High and Critical Blockchain bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. All Medium and Low Blockchain bug reports require a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities involving a direct loss of user funds, double spending, or the minting of tokens are capped at 10% of the economic damage, taking primarily into consideration the funds at risk or the amount of tokens that can be minted but also branding and PR considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__. Consensus manipulation or governance compromise results in the full __USD 250 000__.\n\nA reward can only be provided if:\n  - The bug wasn't reported before.\n  - You do not disclose the bug to other parties or publicity until it's fixed by the Astar dev Team.\n  - You didn't exploit the vulnerability or allow anyone else to profit from it.\n  - You report a bug without any additional conditions or threats.\n  - The investigation was NOT conducted with Ineligible methods or Prohibited Activities, defined in this document.\n  - You should reply to our additional questions regarding the reproduction of the reported bug (if they follow) within a reasonable time (up to 24h for Critical and up to 48hours for other levels of vulnerability)\n  - When duplicate bug reports occur, we reward only the first one if it's provided with enough information for reproduction.\n  - When multiple vulnerabilities are caused by one underlying issue, we will reward only the first reported.\n  - The vulnerability is found in the runtime pallet of Astar (no tests, or modules that aren’t in runtime, e.g. live, can be considered as vulnerability).\n\nAstar requires KYC and an invoice to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed are Name, Address, Email. The collection of this information will be done by the Astar team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Astar Network__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __SDN, ASTR and stable coins in Astar Network__, For Astar specific bugs: 100% USDC or other stable coins on Astar. For Shiden bugs: 75% SDN + 25% USDC other stable coins on Astar. (If the amount is huge, this ratio may be changed)",

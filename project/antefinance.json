      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Challenger decay calculation is inaccurate and slightly overestimates the decay paid by challengers (overall error is < 1%/year even in the worst case scenario). Calculation is more accurate the more often updateDecay() is called.\n  - Staker and challenger balances are slightly underestimated due to rounding issues in intermediate calculations, overall loss is small relative to total pool balance flux (< 0.1%)\n  - Test verification can be frontrun by challengers who stake small amounts of ether in every pool.\n  - checkTest gas usage can be unbounded as it scales linearly with number of unique challengers\n  - Any exploits related to malicious actors cloning and redeploying our contracts (i.e., deploying their own version of AntePoolFactory or deploying AntePools without the use of our AntePoolFactory contract)\n  - Any exploits related to using malicious AnteTests to steal/lock user funds\n\nIn addition to Immunefi’s Vulnerability Severity Classification System, Ante classifies the following vulnerabilities as follows. In case of discrepancy, the one below will be followed. \n\n  - Medium\n    - AntePool contract consumes unbounded gas aside from (i) known scaling of checkTest gas usage with number of challengers or (ii) due to malicious AnteTests that consume unbounded gas \n\nAnte requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is the bug bounty hunter's full name, scan of ID, country and a self-certification that the bug bounty hunter is not a sanctioned person or otherwise prohibited by law from receiving payment from Ante.

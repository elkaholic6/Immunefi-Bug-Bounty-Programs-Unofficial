The uniqueness of this AMM has seen it propel to one of the leading AMMs globally.\n\nFor more information about Trader Joe, please visit [https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home)\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)\n",

However, payouts are done in USDC. Trader Joe commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\n__KYC Requirements:__\n\nTrader Joe __does not__ have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues:__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n- [https://paladinsec.co/projects/trader-joe-dex-v2-1/ ](https://paladinsec.co/projects/trader-joe-dex-v2-1/)\n",

Violation of these rules can result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the Immunefi platform at the sole discretion of the Immunefi team, which may also result in: 1) the forfeiture and loss of access to all bug submissions, and 2) zero payout. \n\nPlease note that Immunefi has no tolerance for spam/low-quality/incomplete bug reports, “beg bounty” behavior, and misrepresentation of assets and severity. Immunefi exists to protect the global crypto community, not facilitate grift.\n\nProhibited: \n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n- [Any other actions prohibited by the Immunefi Rules.](https://immunefi.com/rules/) These rules are subject to change at any time.  \n",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All High and Critical blockchain/DLT bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code are required.\n\nCritical blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__. \n\nHigh blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are scaled based on internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in place. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nWith regard to blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities, only code involving runtime pallets of HydraDX and pallets developed by Galactic Council are considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. Pallets that are not in the runtime, are not live or are under development are considered as out-of-scope of the bug bounty program. \n\nCritical web/app vulnerabilities are scaled based on an internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in-place. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report falls within the scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __HydraDX__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

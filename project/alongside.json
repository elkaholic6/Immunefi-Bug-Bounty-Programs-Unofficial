All High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 20 000__. \n\nCritical Websites and Applications are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__, provided that there is a reasonable path to significant economic damage, determined at the discretion of the team.\n\nAlongside requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is: Legal Name. The collection of this information will be done by the project team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Alongside__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

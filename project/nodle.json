The edge nodes read devices and sensors in the physical world using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and connect that information to the blockchain. Creating a geolocation-based layer one that can be used by many unique applications built for the hyper-connected, mobile-oriented world we live in. Nodle creates an economic model that is secure, private, and scalable.\n\nFor more information about Nodle, please visit [https://www.nodle.com/ ](https://www.nodle.com/) \n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nNodle adheres to category Publication Category 3: Approval Required.

This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\nRewards for critical Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of the funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused.  However, there is a minimum reward of USD 10 000 for Critical Blockchain/DLT bug reports.\n\nRewards for high Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are further capped at 100% of the funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused.  However, there is a minimum reward of USD 2 000 for High Blockchain/DLT bug reports.\n\nRewards for critical web/app vulnerabilities will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 4 000.\n\nHigh web/app vulnerabilities will be further capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 1 000.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Nodle team directly and are denominated in USD.

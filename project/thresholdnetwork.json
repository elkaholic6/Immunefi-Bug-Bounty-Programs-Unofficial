The Threshold Network provides a suite of threshold cryptography products that power user sovereignty on the public blockchain. Threshold cryptography distributes sensitive operations across multiple independent entities, like nodes in a network. A successful operation requires a threshold or a minimum number of entities to cooperate. This simple idea increases security and availability and reduces reliance on trusted parties.Threshold is governed by a DAO whose parts hold separate responsibilities that are embedded in the governance structure. The Threshold DAO has two primary bodies: the Tokenholder DAO (based on the Governor Bravo governance model) and the Elected Council. The goal of this two-pronged structure is to enhance representation while ensuring accountability. Each governance body holds the other accountable, similar to the system of checks and balances found in most constitutional governments. \n\nFor more information about Threshold Network, please visit [https://threshold.network/  ](https://threshold.network/)\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full.

All bug reports without a PoC will not be accepted under this bug bounty program.\n\nAll critical payments for smart contracts are capped at 10% of economic damage. \n\nSushiswap is open to rewarding bounties beyond the critical cap for\nvulnerabilities with extreme impact.\n\nPayouts are handled by the **SushiSwap** team directly and are denominated in **USD**. Payouts worth USD $100,000 and below are done in **USDC**. Payouts beyond USD $100,000 up to USD 200,000 are made in **SUSHI**, though the first $100,000 can be made in **USDC** if requested. ",

Please refer to the rewards section for additional details.\n  - Bugs must be reproducible in order for us to verify the vulnerability.\n  - Rewards and the validity of bugs are determined by the SushiSwap development team and any payouts are made at their sole discretion.\n  - Terms and conditions of the Bug Bounty program can be changed at any time at the discretion of SushiSwap.\n\n__Bug Bounty FAQ__\n\n__Q:__ Is there a time limit for the Bug Bounty program? \n__A:__ No, the Bug Bounty program currently has no end date, but this can be changed at any time at the discretion of SushiSwap.\n\n__Q:__ Can I submit bugs anonymously and still receive payment? \n__A:__ Yes, if you wish to remain anonymous you can do so and still be eligible for rewards as long as they are for valid bugs.

These guidelines outline best practices for the community as whole, whether you are reporting, or the recipient of a report. By stating that you adhere to this policy, you’re claiming to handle vulnerability information ethically, and abide by the following:\n\n  - Do not attempt to leverage a vulnerability, or information of its existence as part of a financial trading strategy or otherwise for financial gain.\n  - Do not attempt to compromise systems upon which development of a product relies; including but not limited to compromising development systems, accounts, domains, email, etc..\n  - Do not attempt to sell vulnerability information or exploits.\n  - Do not ask for any form of compensation from an affected party. You may compensate a disclosing party if you would like to after all known vulnerability details have been disclosed.\n  - Do not disclose a bug or vulnerability on mailing lists, public boards, forums, social media or any other channel prior to Responsibly Disclosing to the organizations you have a published relationship with\n  - Do not attempt any illegal acts, including phishing, physical attacks, DDoS, or any attempt to gain access without authorization.\n\n__3rd Party Affected Projects__\n\nIn the case where we become aware of security issues affecting other projects that have never affected SushiSwap, our intention is to inform those projects of security issues on a best effort basis.\n\nIn the case where we fix a security issue in SushiSwap that also affects the following neighboring projects, our intention is to engage in responsible disclosures with them as described in the adopted standard, subject to the deviations described in the deviations section below.\n\n__Deviations from the Standard__\n\nIn the case of a counterfeiting or fund-stealing bug affecting SushiSwap, however, we might decide not to include those details with our reports to partners ahead of coordinated release, as long as we are sure that they are not vulnerable.\n\n__Notes on Expected Behaviors__\n\n  - Any unaccounted ETH or ERC20 in the BentoBox can be skimmed.\n  - Any reports that involve tokens outside of ERC20s will not be considered in scope.

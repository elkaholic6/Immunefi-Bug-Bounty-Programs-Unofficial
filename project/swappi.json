As an AMM-based DEX, Swappi lets users trade, add liquidity, earn fees and LP tokens, stake LP tokens to earn PPI, and stake PPI for additional rewards and farming opportunities. \n\nSwappi is the very first DEX to launch on eSpace, an EVM-compatible smart contract execution environment built on top of Conflux that allows developers to deploy and execute Ethereum-native dApps and smart contracts within the Conflux ecosystem.\n\nFor more information about Swappi, please visit [https://docs.swappi.io/swappi/](https://docs.swappi.io/swappi/).",

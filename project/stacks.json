This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for each category, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. If there is any discrepancy with the classification in the Impacts in Scope section, the classification in the Impacts in Scope section will hold true.\n\nAll critical bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nAll critical bug reports with direct financial impact are further capped at 10% of economic damage, which primarily takes into consideration the funds at risk while also having some PR and branding considerations, though at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 50 000.\n\nThis bug bounty program is only open to individuals outside the OFAC restricted countries. Bug bounty hunters will be required to provide evidence that they are not a resident or citizen of these countries. If the individual is a US person, tax information will be required, such as a W-9, in order to properly issue a 1099.\n\nVulnerabilities and their impacts mentioned in the following audit reports are ineligible for a reward:\n\n[https://forum.stacks.org/t/stacks-2-0-security-audits/11464](https://forum.stacks.org/t/stacks-2-0-security-audits/11464)\n\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/published/Stacks-2.0-Security-Audit-Resolution-0oyUrm2niuXUc9vS0bgT7rS](https://paper.dropbox.com/published/Stacks-2.0-Security-Audit-Resolution-0oyUrm2niuXUc9vS0bgT7rS) \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ss01em9ly2r92lx/AACehrRuPhms9ONLLTCkIkXIa/Blockstack_Desktop_Wallet_Pentest_Report_11-12-2020.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ss01em9ly2r92lx/AACehrRuPhms9ONLLTCkIkXIa/Blockstack_Desktop_Wallet_Pentest_Report_11-12-2020.pdf?dl=0) \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ss01em9ly2r92lx/AAAy4ktVAYN3kOSbLFs9M4O6a/NCC_Group_Stacks_Blockchain_Audit_Report_2020-11-23_v1.0.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ss01em9ly2r92lx/AAAy4ktVAYN3kOSbLFs9M4O6a/NCC_Group_Stacks_Blockchain_Audit_Report_2020-11-23_v1.0.pdf?dl=0) \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ss01em9ly2r92lx/AAB4wj-g0c7RUbjrYLhRApdza/NCC_Group_Stacks_Wallet_Report_2020-11-17_v1.0.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ss01em9ly2r92lx/AAB4wj-g0c7RUbjrYLhRApdza/NCC_Group_Stacks_Wallet_Report_2020-11-17_v1.0.pdf?dl=0) \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Stacks Foundation__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app and all Critical severity smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nAll issues previously highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n  - [https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Wombat-v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Wombat-v1.0.pdf)\n  - [https://hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WombatExchange_20042022SCAudit_Report_3.pdf](https://hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WombatExchange_20042022SCAudit_Report_3.pdf)\n  - [https://www.wombat.exchange/zokyo_wombat_audit_report.pdf](https://www.wombat.exchange/zokyo_wombat_audit_report.pdf)\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 100 000__ only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than __USD 20 000__.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Wombat Exchange__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

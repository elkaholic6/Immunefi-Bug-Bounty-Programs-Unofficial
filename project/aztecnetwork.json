Only includes deanonymization of publicly broadcast data.\n\nFor “Weak encryption” under Medium, depending on their impact, encryption bugs could be treated as more severe.

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nFor the ZK-SNARK circuits, the classification will be based on the impacts listed in the Impacts in Scope section below. The exploitability of the vulnerability reported will be taken into consideration when determining the final reward. The Blockchain/DLT section in the Immunefi Severity Classification System is overruled by these changes. \n\nThe rewards for the Circuits & Cryptography section, labeled as Blockchain/DLT in this bug bounty program, are only for the ZK-SNARK Circuits assets.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 5% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team.

      "programOverview": "Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers in a common pool. Suppliers provide liquidity to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.\n\nFor more information about Aave, please visit [https://aave.com/.](https://aave.com/) \n\nAave provides rewards in a mix of AAVE and stablecoins. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\nAave is represented by its service providers [BGD Labs](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs) (Aave v2/v3/SM/Governance) and [Aave Companies](https://twitter.com/aaveaave) (GHO) BGD and Aave Companies as appointed representatives of the DAO exclusively in this context, based on a successful Aave governance proposal. GHO components will be added to this bug bounty program shortly pending administrative aspects.\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC may be required for a reward for this bug bounty program at the discretion of the DAO representative or representatives. If KYC is requested, the following information will be required to be done:\n- Live video call where the following may be asked:\n   - Government-issued ID \n\nKYC will not be required for bug reports classified with a severity level as Medium or Low.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nAave adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nAave adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Manipulation of governance voting result deviating from voted outcome and resulting in a direct change from intended effect of original results\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Direct theft of any user funds classified as the principal, whether at-rest or in-motion\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Permanent locking of user funds classified as the principal\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the impact affects something in the BGD repo, select the placeholder containing the link to the BGD repo instead. \n\nIf the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files, as well as non-active features, defined as features that 1) are not introduced in production and 2) are not able to be used due to configurations of the protocol, are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nAave commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Aave will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\nFor privacy and security reasons, self-reported bug submissions will only have a hash as its contents. In the event that proof is needed to demonstrate that the issue is known, the respective file will be sent for evaluation to check if the hashes match with the earlier self-reported entry.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nAave has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n\n__Governance-Run Program__\n\nThis bug bounty program is governed by a governance proposal. To view the governance proposal poll, visit [https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=325](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=325) .\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 1 000 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 50 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.  \n\n__Reward Calculation for Direct theft of any funds in the Aave Treasury__\n\nFor the impact “Direct theft of any funds in the Aave Treasury”, which is considered as High, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 75 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated within the first 45 minutes from the first attack, inclusive, no matter how many times the attack can be executed within that time frame, as demonstrated by the PoC provided by the security researcher. For avoidance of doubt, if a vulnerability is discovered that can steal USD 1 million 30 times within 45 minutes from the first execution of the attack, then the funds at risk is considered as USD 30 million. \n\nHowever, for smart contracts directly holding funds that cannot be paused, if a discovered vulnerability includes the temporary locking of funds that could otherwise be withdrawn and thus prevented from being stolen but still accessible to the exploiter to take the funds, the time is extended to the exact same time as temporary locking. Extensions of the temporary locking that introduce a gap where withdrawals can happen will not be considered. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities will be capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary locking, the reward doubles for every additional 3600 blocks that the funds or NFTs could be temporarily locked, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 3600 blocks, up to the hard cap of USD 75 000. However, there is a further hard cap of 1000% of the funds affected after the multiplier effect of the duration of temporary locking. \n\nIf the duration of temporary locking is 3600 blocks or less, then the severity level will be reduced to Medium if the amount is equal to or greater than USD 1 000 000. If not, the severity level will be downgraded to Low. \n\nUnless downgraded, all bug reports with a severity level of High at the end of the evaluation of the bug report will have a minimum reward of USD 10 000. \n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- Official Contributors, defined as:\n   - Developers who have worked on Aave Companies or BGD at some point in time. Contributor with a meaningful amount of commits on Aave-related repositories.\n   - Developers associated with forks of the protocol are also considered official contributors.\n   - Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the review of the system impacted.\n   - Entities that were compensated anyhow with funds of the DAO (excluding bounties recipients).\n- Former Official Contributors who have contributed within 12 months before the bug report \n\nFor avoidance of doubt, the following are explicitly not ineligible for the bug bounty program:\n- Independent security researchers.\n- Independent contributors to Aave via small commits.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nAave has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward. However, you are encouraged to review these audits in order to get a better understanding of the codebase\n\n__V3.0.1 and V3.0.2__\n\n- [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/23-12-2022_SigmaPrime_AaveV3-0-1.pdf ](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/23-12-2022_SigmaPrime_AaveV3-0-1.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/certora/Aave_V3.0.1_Formal_Verification_Report_Dec2022.pdf](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/certora/Aave_V3.0.1_Formal_Verification_Report_Dec2022.pdf) \n- [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/09-12-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3-0-1.pdf ](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/09-12-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3-0-1.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/bgd-labs/proposal-3.0.2-upgrade/blob/main/audits/19-04-2023_SigmaPrime_AaveV3-0-2.pdf](https://github.com/bgd-labs/proposal-3.0.2-upgrade/blob/main/audits/19-04-2023_SigmaPrime_AaveV3-0-2.pdf) \n\n__V3.0.0__\n\n- [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_SigmaPrime_AaveV3.pdf](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_SigmaPrime_AaveV3.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/certora/Aave_V3_Formal_Verification_Report_Jan2022.pdf](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/certora/Aave_V3_Formal_Verification_Report_Jan2022.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/01-11-2021_OpenZeppelin_AaveV3.pdf](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/01-11-2021_OpenZeppelin_AaveV3.pdf)\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nBug reports that require an attack that involve one or more other protocols (e.g. utilizing flash loans from a margin protocol or manipulating the spot prices on a DEX), either to make an attack more severe than it would be in isolation, or to achieve an attack that would otherwise be impossible or infeasible, will be downgraded or rejected entirely, at the discretion of the DAO representatives. However, they will be considered as in-scope and categorized according to the program rules as long as all of the following are true:\n- Losses or other negative effects of the attack are inflicted upon Aave ecosystem participants \n- The additional protocols used must have enough liquidity in various assets to allow the attack to succeed at the time of bug report submission. For example: if an attack requires an ETH flash loan, but the amount is larger than all the ETH available for loan across the ecosystem, then this would not be satisfied\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for all Smart Contract bug reports.\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\n- Exploits consequence of newly publicly available information will be considered only if they are non-evident. Examples:\n   - Evident - A stablecoin (listed on Aave) gets exploited and that has immediate consequences on Aave via borrowing attacks or others.\n   - Non-evident - A Solidity compiler bug is found, and some logic used on Aave is affected. In addition, the nature of the way the bug affects Aave is totally different for the review team to not link the compiler bug with Aave’s impact.\n- On attacks involving market manipulation, a solid and realistic scenario needs to be presented in order for the bug report to be considered eligible for consideration.\n   - Realistic Scenario Example - Manipulation of an asset listed as collateral is possible via flash loans, allowing for borrowing of all available liquidity.\n   - Non-Realistic Scenario Example - Manipulation of an asset listed as collateral, but not via flash loans, depending on CL oracle update with the manipulated price, and putting at risk considerable capital.\n- Attacks whose losses materialize via market dynamics, like shorting of AAVE in parallel with the exploit, will not take into account that component when determining the severity level. Thus, other impacts according to the Impacts in Scope Table will be considered when determining the severity level of the bug report.\n- Precision mechanisms on aToken and other tokenization (due to balance growing) are out of scope unless they enable a provable new attack vector involving loss of funds.\n- Loss of rewards-to-be-accrued is initially not considered a loss of funds.

Thus, in order to be eligible for a reward, the vulnerability must exist both in the deployed smart contract and the respective GitHub file in the Assets in Scope table, otherwise the bug report will be considered as invalid.\n   - All addresses can be found at https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-address-book/tree/main/src \n   - The production instance of Aave v3 StakedAaveV3 can be found at https://etherscan.io/token/0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5 \n- The following assets have their inheritance chain of contracts also included as in-scope for the bug bounty program within the limitations of the respective asset being in v2 or v3. The OpenZeppelin base contract, however, is not considered as in-scope.

However, payments are done in a mix of AAVE and a stablecoin with a tight correlation to USD 1 with equal to or less than 0.5% average deviation over a period of 1 month preceding the submission of the bug report, at the discretion of BGD Labs. \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price of the past 30 days immediately preceding the bug report time. For avoidance of doubt, this will be calculated as exactly 720 hours preceding the bug report time. However, the stablecoin used will always have an effective value of USD 1. \n\nDue to the limitations with DAO payments, each valid bug report will require its own proposal within the DAO for payment. Though this will be coordinated with the DAO representatives and the security researcher submitting the report will not be required to be involved, this delays payments to the end of each month. \n\nAs details about the bug report need to be included in the governance proposal, a proposal cannot be made until a fix has been implemented, due to the security risks of publicly disclosing a live vulnerability. \n",

        "renderedOutput": "<p>Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. </p><p><strong>Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports</strong></p><p>For critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 1 000 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 50 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.  </p><p><strong>Reward Calculation for Direct theft of any funds in the Aave Treasury</strong></p><p>For the impact “Direct theft of any funds in the Aave Treasury”, which is considered as High, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 75 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded.</p><p><strong>Repeatable Attack Limitations</strong></p><p>In cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated within the first 45 minutes from the first attack, inclusive, no matter how many times the attack can be executed within that time frame, as demonstrated by the PoC provided by the security researcher. For avoidance of doubt, if a vulnerability is discovered that can steal USD 1 million 30 times within 45 minutes from the first execution of the attack, then the funds at risk is considered as USD 30 million. </p><p>However, for smart contracts directly holding funds that cannot be paused, if a discovered vulnerability includes the temporary locking of funds that could otherwise be withdrawn and thus prevented from being stolen but still accessible to the exploiter to take the funds, the time is extended to the exact same time as temporary locking. Extensions of the temporary locking that introduce a gap where withdrawals can happen will not be considered. </p><p><strong>Reward Calculation for High Level Reports</strong></p><p>High smart contract vulnerabilities will be capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary locking, the reward doubles for every additional 3600 blocks that the funds or NFTs could be temporarily locked, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 3600 blocks, up to the hard cap of USD 75 000. However, there is a further hard cap of 1000% of the funds affected after the multiplier effect of the duration of temporary locking. </p><p>If the duration of temporary locking is 3600 blocks or less, then the severity level will be reduced to Medium if the amount is equal to or greater than USD 1 000 000. If not, the severity level will be downgraded to Low. </p><p>Unless downgraded, all bug reports with a severity level of High at the end of the evaluation of the bug report will have a minimum reward of USD 10 000. </p><p><strong>Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility</strong></p><p>Security researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward</p><ul><li>Official Contributors, defined as:<ul><li>Developers who have worked on Aave Companies or BGD at some point in time.

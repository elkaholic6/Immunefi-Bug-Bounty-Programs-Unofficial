This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports and all Critical/High severity smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 30 000__ and a maximum of __USD 100 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 20 000__ only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds or a manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than __USD 10 000__.\n\nThe following impacts/vulnerabilities are considered out of scope: \n  - Attacks caused by rebase tokens, fee-on-transfer tokens or non-standard ERC20 tokens are out of scope unless such token has deployed and configured Silo with user funds or has a pending DAO proposal for its Silo.\n  - On-chain oracle manipulation attacks (BalV2 TWAP, UniV3 TWAP and future integrations).\n  - Interest rate manipulation caused by lack of liquidity.\n  - Liquidation front-running.\n\nIn addition, known issues highlighted in the below audits reports are considered out of scope: \n  - [Certora Formal Verification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D2EIOb0XaRov5Ph2AE0DTfIsMISd7UXG/view?usp=sharing)\n  - [ABDK Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WXaB3ICLv4rSEX86POK3-NaOIxXwyq9l/view?usp=sharing)\n  - [Quantstamp Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10GyfA-nBJ5jqLWW9LEYJQeFem8qSgNH6/view?usp=sharing)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Silo Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

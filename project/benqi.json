      "programOverview": "__BENQI Liquidity Market__\n\nBENQI Liquidity Market is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol, built on Avalanche. The protocol enables users to effortlessly lend, borrow, and earn interest with their digital assets. Depositors providing liquidity to the protocol may earn passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over-collateralized manner.\n\nBENQI aims to alleviate common DeFi problems by providing a Liquidity Market Protocol on a highly scalable and decentralized platform. With a focus on approachability, ease of use, and low fees, BENQI will democratize access to decentralized financial products by providing permissionless lending and borrowing where users can:\n\n  - Instantly supply to and withdraw liquidity from a shared liquidity market\n  - Instantly borrow from a liquidity market using their supplied assets as collateral\n  - Have a live and transparent view of interest rates around the clock based on the asset's market supply and demand\n\n__BENQI Liquid Staking__\n\nBENQI Liquid Staking (BLS) is a liquid staking protocol built on Avalanche. It tokenizes staked AVAX and allows users to freely use it within Decentralized Finance dApps such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs), Lending & Borrowing Protocols, Yield Aggregators, etc.\n\nBLS allows users to stake AVAX on the Avalanche C-Chain* without needing to stake on the Avalanche P-Chain*. This allows users to earn validating rewards from the P-Chain without running a full node or locking up AVAX on a validating node.\n\nFor more information about BENQI, please visit [https://docs.benqi.fi/](https://docs.benqi.fi/). \n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and the prevention of loss of user funds, thefts and freezing of principal of any amount, thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount, theft of governance funds, denial of service, DNS hijack attacks, and social media administrative control breaches.

      "programOverview": "Cronos core team announces a Cronos bug bounty program, with a maximum bounty of up to USD $250,000 sponsored by Blockchain accelerator Particle B to enhance on-chain security of the Cronos ecosystem. The security campaign, in partnership with Immunefi, is focused on discovering potential technical vulnerabilities and strengthening smart contract security.\n\nThe Cronos core team puts security as its top priority and has dedicated resources to ensure high incentives to attract the community-at-large to evaluate and safeguard the ecosystem. Whilst building Cronos, the team has engaged with industry leading cybersecurity audit firms specializing in Blockchain Security to help secure the codebase of Ethermint. We encourage smart contract developers, whitehat hackers to participate, evaluate the code base and hunt for bugs especially on issues that could potentially put users’ funds at risk. In exchange, the bug bounty program will reward up to USD $250,000 based on the vulnerability severity level.\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on Cronos (blockchain), smart contracts and decentralised applications with the emphasis on any vulnerabilities causing unintentional withdrawal/draining of funds/loss of user funds. The program also extends to key projects in the Cronos ecosystem, including VVS Finance as the first project with more DeFi projects to come. Cronos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain running in parallel to the Crypto.org Chain. It aims to massively scale the DeFi and decentralised application (DApp) ecosystem, by providing developers with the ability to instantly port apps from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. With low cost, high throughput, fast finality, and built-in interoperability, Cronos is poised to bring decentralized applications to the 80M+ user base of the Crypto.com ecosystem and beyond.\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "__Impacts in Scope__\n\nOnly the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\nHowever, only the following impact is considered as in-scope, though the severity level may be Critical, High, or Medium based on the conditions above:\n\n- Impacts that directly lead to loss of user funds, or breach of sensitive data, or deletion of site data. \n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain/DLT__\n\n__Critical__\n  - Empty or freeze the contract's holdings (e.g. economic attacks, flash loans, reentrancy, logic errors, integer over-/under-flow).\n  - Cryptographic flaws.\n  - Cronos (blockchain), smart contracts and app with the focus on any vulnerabilities causing unintentional withdrawal/draining of funds/loss of user funds.\n\n__High__\n  - User Impersonation\n  - Theft of yield.\n  - Transient consensus failures.\n\n__Medium__\n  - Contract consumes unbounded gas.\n  - Block stuffing.\n  - Griefing denial of service (i.e. attacker spends as much in gas as damage to the contract).\n  - Gas griefing.\n\n__Web/App__\n\nAll web vulnerabilities are covered here.\n- Remote Code Execution\n- Significant manipulation of the account balance\n- Leakage of sensitive data\n- XSS/CSRF/Clickjacking affecting sensitive actions\n- Theft of privileged information\n- Partial authentication bypass\n- Other vulnerability with clear potential for financial or data loss\n- Other XSS (excluding Self-XSS)\n- Other CSRF (excluding logout CSRF)\n",
      "rewardsBody": "All bug reports must come with a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) in order to be considered for a reward. For web/app bug reports, if the Report does not include a valid (PoC), the qualification of rewards will be decided according to reproducibility and severity of the vulnerability, and the rewards amount may be reduced significantly. The specific amount of the bounty will vary according to:\n\n- The effect of the bug.\n- The cause of the bug.\n- Whether or not the person who reports the bug suggests a solution to the bug or helps in its resolution.\n\nCritical smart contract and blockchain vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily focused on the funds at risk, but also taking into account branding and PR considerations, at the discretion of the team. \n\nAll vulnerabilities that directly affect the Cronos blockchain, smart contract, and app that directly cause unintentional withdrawals, draining of funds, or loss of user funds, are considered as Critical.\n\nThe only web vulnerabilities in scope are those which will directly lead to loss of user funds, or breach of sensitive data, or deletion of site data. As stated in the severity classification system, the Cronos team will use CVSS calculator to figure out the severity and based on that they will determine the reward for the bounty.\n\nCronos team requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. Once the report is deemed valid, you will need to fill up the KYC form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNamV48ENwK78AMAqRHTFaAjcFJ9JWE2V6jlfQaQjur6SS0Q/viewform). The collection of this information will be done by the Cronos team.\n\nPayouts are handled by Cronos team and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in USDC and USDT only, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the Cronos team.\n\nDisclaimer: Cronos team reserves the ultimate decision and will determine at its discretion whether a vulnerability is eligible for a reward and the amount of the award depending on severity.\n",

However, there is a minimum reward of USD 10 000 for High impact web/app impact vulnerabilities and USD 15 000 for Critical web/app impact vulnerabilities. Rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Gnosis Chain__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

You can stake your SOL tokens with Marinade and receive \"marinated SOL\" tokens (mSOL) that you can use in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThe price of mSOL goes up relative to SOL each epoch, with rewards being accrued into the underlying staked SOL. Marinade stakes in 400+ validators that are selected automatically by an open-source fair formula based on performance, commission and decentralization.\n\nMarinade includes mSOL->SOL swap, so you can “Unstake Now!” and receive your SOL immediately with a small fee. You can also directly exchange between mSOL and SOL on secondary markets at the current rate. Finally, you can unstake your SOL with zero-fee by waiting 4-6 days for the Solana cool-down period (delayed-unstake). \n\nAs of November 2021, Marinade’s TVL is around 1.5b USD\n\nFor more information about Marinade Finance, please visit [https://marinade.finance/](https://marinade.finance/) and [https://docs.marinade.finance](https://docs.marinade.finance) \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft\n  - Loss of governance funds\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds\n  - Unable to call smart contract\n",

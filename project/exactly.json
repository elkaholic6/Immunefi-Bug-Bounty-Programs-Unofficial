Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.</p><p>Critical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of <strong>USD 25 000</strong>. </p><p>KYC is required for this bug bounty program. Government identification, legal name, and country of residence will need to be supplied.</p><p>Payouts are handled by the <strong>Exactly</strong> team directly and are denominated in USD.

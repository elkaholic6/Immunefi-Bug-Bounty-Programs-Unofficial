StarkEx enables an application to scale significantly and improve transaction speed while also reducing transaction costs.StarkEx is a production-grade platform that has been deployed on Ethereum Mainnet since June 2020 and settled over $800B since then.\n\nFor more information about StarkEx, please visit [https://starkware.co/starkex/. ](https://starkware.co/starkex/)\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nStarkEx adheres to category 2. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nStarkEx adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the Immunefi [Bug Report Template and Best Practices](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template). \n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are considered out-of-scope and ineligible for payout.",
      "rewardsBody": "__Reward Distribution__\n\nPlease review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2.](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/) This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Blockchain/DLTs and Smart Contracts.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements__\n\nPayouts are handled by StarkWare directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in USDC. StarkWare commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nRewards for both critical Blockchain/DLT and critical Smart Contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 40 000 and a maximum reward of USD 500 000 for Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities; minimum reward of USD 50 000 and a maximum reward of USD 1 000 000 for Smart Contracts vulnerabilities. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Rule program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\nStarkWare does have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\nStarkWare requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is a full legal name, residential address, date of birth and copy of national ID/passport. Bounty hunters must pass OFAC Screening. Rewards cannot be paid out if hunters are on the OFAC SDN list and/or do not complete the KYC.\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n[https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/tree/master/audit ](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/tree/master/audit)\n",

Violation of these rules can result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the Immunefi platform at the sole discretion of the Immunefi team, which may also result in: 1) the forfeiture and loss of access to all bug submissions, and 2) zero payout. \n\nPlease note that Immunefi has no tolerance for spam/low-quality/incomplete bug reports, “beg bounty” behavior, and misrepresentation of assets and severity. Immunefi exists to protect the global crypto community, not facilitate grift.\n\nProhibited: \n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n- [Any other actions prohibited by the Immunefi Rules.](https://immunefi.com/rules/) These rules are subject to change at any time.  \n",

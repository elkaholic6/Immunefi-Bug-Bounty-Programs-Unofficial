However, there is a minimum reward of USD 1,000 for each severity level, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Helio__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

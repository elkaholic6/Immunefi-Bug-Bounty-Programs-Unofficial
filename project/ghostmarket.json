However, there is a minimum reward of USD 15 000. </p><p>On the Vesting contract a critical or high bug has to affect vested funds.</p><p>All Medium, High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.</p><p>All web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward.

Therefore, the vulnerability for withdrawing funds from this contract should be considered out of scope. </p><p>The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:</p><ul><li>Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage</li><li>Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials</li><li>Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)</li></ul><p><strong>Smart Contracts and Blockchain</strong></p><ul><li>Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles<ul><li>Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks</li></ul></li><li>Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)</li><li>Lack of liquidity</li><li>Best practice critiques</li><li>Sybil attacks</li><li>Centralization risks</li></ul><p>The following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:</p><ul><li>Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets</li><li>Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts</li><li>Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers</li><li>Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)</li><li>Any denial of service attacks</li><li>Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic</li><li>Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty</li></ul>",

Rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Frontrunning protection for Agent (Bot) registrations are disabled\n\nThe rewards for the Forta Network section, labeled as Blockchain/DLT in this bug bounty program, are only for the Forta Network assets.\n\nForta requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward.

When reporting a bug, please make sure to select the relevant proxy smart contract as the target. \n\nIf an impact can be caused to any other asset managed by Forta that isn’t on this table but for which the impact is in the Impacts in Scope section below, you are encouraged to submit it for the consideration by the project. This applies to only Critical and High impacts. \n\nExceptions: The are specific bugs not eligible for a Bounty, as they have already been identified and fixes are in progress.\n  - A protocol vulnerability where a Scan Pool Owner is able to withdraw their stake without disabling their scan nodes if there is enough Delegated Stake in the Scan Pool.  The intention was to always require Owners to have a minimum stake level so that they always have a direct incentive to avoid malicious activity.  \nThe Delegator’s stake should be unallocated when owner’s stake is withdrawn Add check to disableScanner before decrementing the amount of enabled scanners in a scanner pool Bypassing of max allocation by staking very large amount (needs to be further clarified) \n  - Issue in setting up a new pool with large stake setDelegationParams function in RewardsDistributor not setting delegationParamsEpochDelay \n  - Setting a pool's fee to 0 causes the pool's fee to actually become 100% because the contract assumes that trying to set it to 0 means there is no fee set, and thus defaults to 100%. \n  - Signing up for subscriptions repeatedly and hitting verify email a lot which sends a lot of emails\n  - Bots that emit too many alerts\n  - An owner can emit infinite bots, and too many is too many - but staking mitigates that and we can slash + take other actions\n  - Nodes that handle their nodes insecurely - putting them on the public internet  / exposing sensitive credentials within network endpoints\n  - Someone with a private key of an enabled&staked scan node can submit fake alerts for any bot \n\nFor more documentation, please refer to [https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/).

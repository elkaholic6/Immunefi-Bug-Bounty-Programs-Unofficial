      "programOverview": "SMARDEX is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that addresses the issue of Impermanent Loss (IL) and in some cases transforms it into Impermanent Gain (IG). It is an open-source Smart Contract, which is a decentralized software that runs on compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchains (such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, etc.). These blockchains are data exchange protocols that, similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, allow for the storage and transmission of information in a public, immutable, and decentralized manner. By using SMARDEX, users can exchange decentralized ERC20 tokens, which are digital assets.\n\nFor more information about SmarDex, please visit [https://smardex.io/ ](https://smardex.io/) \n\nSmarDex provides rewards in SDEX. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nSmarDex adheres to category 3: Approval Required. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication ](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/)page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nSmarDex adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nSmarDex commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that SmarDex will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nSmarDex has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nThis bug bounty program is divided into Group 1 and Group 2:\n- Group 1: consists of Ethereum assets\n- Group 2: consists of all other chains\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerability payouts for Group 1 are a minimum of USD 20 000 or 5% of the value at risk at the time of report submission, with a hard cap of USD 4 000 000, whichever is larger. Value at risk should be calculated primarily (though not exclusively) based on concrete and demonstrable funds at risk.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerability payouts for Group 2 are a minimum of USD 20 000, or 5% of the value at risk at the time of report submission, with a hard cap of USD 400 000, whichever is larger. Value at risk should be calculated primarily (though not exclusively) based on concrete and demonstrable funds at risk.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nThe payout is determined to be 10% of the value at risk. The minimum reward is set at $15,000. The maximum rewards (hard cap) are as follows:  \n- USD 50 000 for  Theft of unclaimed yield (for value of USD 500 000 at risk or greater)\n- USD 50 000 for Theft of unclaimed royalties (for value of USD 500 000 at risk)\n- USD 20 000 for Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield (for value of USD 200 000 at risk)\n- USD 20 000 for  Permanent freezing of unclaimed royalties (for value of USD 200 000 at risk)\n- USD 15 000 for Temporary freezing of funds (for value of USD 150 000 at risk)\n\nValue at risk should be calculated primarily (though not exclusively) based on concrete and demonstrable funds at risk\n\n__Reward Calculation for Medium Level Reports__\n\nMedium smart contract vulnerabilities will be paid out by the following:\n- USD 15 000 for Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)\n- USD 10 000 for Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds\n- USD 5 000 for Block stuffing\n- USD 1 000 for Theft of gas\n- USD 1 000 for  Unbounded gas consumption\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- Data manipulation with very high and/or very small numbers that would be theoretically possible but not applicable in real conditions.\n- Swap with bigger amount than fictive reserves are impossible even if the contracts theoretically hold enough tokens to execute the trade.\n- Farming DOS\n- Block stuffing to avoid the 300s protection and to exploit the vulnerability described in the white paper, section III. A.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nSmarDex has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any fixed, unfixed or acknowledged vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n-[ https://smardex.io/audit-reports](https://smardex.io/audit-reports)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n- Smart Contract - Low\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\nThis bug bounty program is divided into Group 1 and Group 2 for the Critical Smart Contract reward\n- Group 1: consists of Ethereum assets\n- Group 2: consists of all other chains\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the SmarDex team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in SDEX. \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n",

No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.

The Bedrock release primarily consists of the core software required to run L2 blockchains and was originally designed to power an upgrade to the OP Mainnet network. Bedrock improves on its predecessor by reducing transaction fees using optimized batch compression and Ethereum as a data availability layer; shortening delays of including L1 transactions in rollups by handling L1 re-orgs more gracefully; enabling modular proof systems through code re-use; and improving node performance by removing technical debt.\n\nTo read more about Optimism, please visit [https://www.optimism.io/](https://www.optimism.io/). To learn about the OP Stack, please visit [https://stack.optimism.io/](https://stack.optimism.io/). \n\nThe Optimism network is scheduled to undergo a major upgrade from the currently running (legacy) system to the Bedrock system on Jun 6, 2023. This bounty program will actively cover both the legacy system, as well as the Bedrock system defined by the contracts which are already deployed. \nFor both the legacy system and the forthcoming bedrock system this bounty program is focused on preventing:\n\n  - theft of assets held in their smart contracts;\n  - theft, freezing or other loss of funds due to vulnerabilities in the smart contracts’ or the critical blockchain client services (op-node and op-geth).\n\nIn order to encourage reporting of issues in time for us to review and react, no reports will be accepted after 9 AM EDT on June 5th, 2023.

However, there is a minimum of __USD 75 000__ for Critical bug reports.\n\nFor testing any exploits involving cross-domain transactions, we recommend working with our [dockerized services](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/6f8e432506a5f4ba094f091b22a0bb6acc53fdac/ops/README.md) and modifying our [integration tests](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/6f8e432506a5f4ba094f091b22a0bb6acc53fdac/integration-tests/test/bridged-tokens.spec.ts)\n\nThe following known issues are considered to be out of scope of this bug bounty program.\n\n__Known issue for both the legacy and bedrock systems:__\n\n  - There appears to be an obvious bug which would allow an attacker to withdraw a fake ERC20 token from L2 in exchange for a real ERC20 (such as WBTC) token on L1. There is no check in the L2StandardBridge, however the withdrawal is prevented from finalizing by a check in the L1StandardBridge. Naturally if you do find a way to circumvent our protections, then we would reward you.\n  - The fact that their contracts are upgradable via a multisig. \n  - The fact that fault proofs are not yet running.\n  - A bug in Lib_MerkleTrie.sol which will prevent withdrawals from succeeding in some cases. There is a workaround for this, by modifying the proof to add an extra element.\n  - A bug in Lib_ResolvedDelegateProxy.sol which could result in a storage slot key collision overwriting the address of the implementation. This bug is dependent on the layout of the implementation contract, and Optimism is not affected.\n\n__Known issues for the legacy system:__\n\n  - The user cannot commit to a L1 gas price, the OVM_GasPriceOracle is owned by a key controlled by Optimism and is responsible for setting the L1 gas price.\n\n__Known issues for the Bedrock system:__\n\n  - There is an edge case in which ETH deposited to the OptimismPortal by a contract can be irrecoverably stranded:\n    - When a deposit transaction fails to execute, the sender’s account balance is still credited with the mint value. However, if the deposit’s L1 sender is a contract, the tx.origin on L2 will be aliased, and this aliased address will receive the minted on L2. In general the contract on L1 will not be able to recover these funds. We have documented this risk and encourage users to take advantage of our CrossDomainMessenger contracts which provide additional safety measures.\n  - Deposit transactions can be grieffed at a cost to the attacker, by filling up the MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT. This issue is mitigated by PR 5064, which does not completely resolve the issue but does increase the cost of a sustained griefing attack. A more complete fix will require architectural changes.\n  - There are various ‘foot guns’ in the bridge which may arise from misconfiguring a token. To minimize complexity our bridge design does not try to prevent all forms of developer and user error. \nExamples of such foot guns include:\n    - Having both (or neither of) the local and remote tokens be OptimismMintable. \n    - Tokens which dynamically alter the amount of a token held by an account, such as fee-on-transfer and rebasing tokens.\n  - When running in non-archive mode op-geth has difficulty executing deep reorgs.

However, there is a minimum of <strong>USD 75 000</strong> for Critical bug reports.</p><p>For testing any exploits involving cross-domain transactions, we recommend working with our <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/6f8e432506a5f4ba094f091b22a0bb6acc53fdac/ops/README.md\">dockerized services</a> and modifying our <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/6f8e432506a5f4ba094f091b22a0bb6acc53fdac/integration-tests/test/bridged-tokens.spec.ts\">integration tests</a></p><p>The following known issues are considered to be out of scope of this bug bounty program.</p><p><strong>Known issue for both the legacy and bedrock systems:</strong></p><ul><li>There appears to be an obvious bug which would allow an attacker to withdraw a fake ERC20 token from L2 in exchange for a real ERC20 (such as WBTC) token on L1. There is no check in the L2StandardBridge, however the withdrawal is prevented from finalizing by a check in the L1StandardBridge. Naturally if you do find a way to circumvent our protections, then we would reward you.</li><li>The fact that their contracts are upgradable via a multisig. </li><li>The fact that fault proofs are not yet running.</li><li>A bug in Lib_MerkleTrie.sol which will prevent withdrawals from succeeding in some cases. There is a workaround for this, by modifying the proof to add an extra element.</li><li>A bug in Lib_ResolvedDelegateProxy.sol which could result in a storage slot key collision overwriting the address of the implementation. This bug is dependent on the layout of the implementation contract, and Optimism is not affected.</li></ul><p><strong>Known issues for the legacy system:</strong></p><ul><li>The user cannot commit to a L1 gas price, the OVM_GasPriceOracle is owned by a key controlled by Optimism and is responsible for setting the L1 gas price.</li></ul><p><strong>Known issues for the Bedrock system:</strong></p><ul><li>There is an edge case in which ETH deposited to the OptimismPortal by a contract can be irrecoverably stranded:<ul><li>When a deposit transaction fails to execute, the sender’s account balance is still credited with the mint value. However, if the deposit’s L1 sender is a contract, the tx.origin on L2 will be aliased, and this aliased address will receive the minted on L2. In general the contract on L1 will not be able to recover these funds. We have documented this risk and encourage users to take advantage of our CrossDomainMessenger contracts which provide additional safety measures.</li></ul></li><li>Deposit transactions can be grieffed at a cost to the attacker, by filling up the MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT. This issue is mitigated by PR 5064, which does not completely resolve the issue but does increase the cost of a sustained griefing attack. A more complete fix will require architectural changes.</li><li>There are various ‘foot guns’ in the bridge which may arise from misconfiguring a token. To minimize complexity our bridge design does not try to prevent all forms of developer and user error.\nExamples of such foot guns include:<pre><code>- Having both (or neither of) the local and remote tokens be OptimismMintable. \n- Tokens which dynamically alter the amount of a token held by an account, such as fee-on-transfer and rebasing tokens.\n</code></pre></li><li>When running in non-archive mode op-geth has difficulty executing deep reorgs. We are working on a fix.</li></ul><p>Payouts are handled by the <strong>Optimism</strong> team directly and are denominated in USD. All payouts are done in <strong>USDC</strong>.</p>",

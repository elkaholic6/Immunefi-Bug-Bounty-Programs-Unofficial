This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into account the funds at risk. Other considerations such as PR and branding concerns may also be considered by the team at its discretion.  However, there is no minimum reward for Critical impacts.\n\nIn order to be considered for a reward, all bug reports must include:\n\n  - URLs affected\n  - Description\n  - Impact\n  - Proof of concept (with screenshots or video if applicable)\n  - Mitigation/recommended fix\n\nPayouts are handled by the __CoinFLEX__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

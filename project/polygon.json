However, please refer to the Impacts in Scope section for a more accurate classification of impacts as well as the impacts that are accepted within the program.\n\nA PoC and a suggestion for a fix is required for all bug reports. A high-quality suggestion for a fix may come with a bonus from the Polygon team.\n\nAll bug reports must include the following information in order to be considered for a reward:\n\nSummary:\n  - add summary of the vulnerability\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n  - add details for how we can reproduce the issue\n\n  1.  add step\n  1.  add step\n  1.  add step\n\nSupporting Material/References:\n - list any additional material (e.g. screenshots, logs, etc.)\n    - attachment / reference\n\nBug reports containing the following will not be eligible for a reward with this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Previously known vulnerabilities (resolved or not) on the Ethereum network (and any other fork of these).\n  - Previously known vulnerabilities in Tendermint and or/any other fork of these.\n  - Previously known vulnerabilities in cosmos-sdk and or/any other fork of these.\n  - Previously known vulnerable libraries without a working Proof of Concept.\n  - Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.\n  - Public Zero-day vulnerabilities that have had an official patch for less than 1 month will be awarded on a case by case basis.\n\nCritical Smart Contract bug reports are further capped at 10% of economic damage, which primarily takes into consideration the funds at risk but may include branding and PR aspects at the discretion of the team. However, they have a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Polygon__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __MATIC__.

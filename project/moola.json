Bug bounty hunters will need to show a government-issued ID, including a physical address.\n\n__Critical Smart Contract reward__ is $10,000 USD or up to 1% of MOO supply\n__High Smart Contract reward__ $5,000 USD or up to 0.5% of MOO supply\n__Critical Web/App reward__ is 2,000 USD or up to 0.2% of MOO supply\n__High Web/App reward__ is 1,000 USD or up to 0.1% of MOO supply\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Moola__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __cUSD__ or __MOO__ at the discretion of the team. For payouts done in __MOO__, the price of __MOO__ will be calculated based on a 30-day average USD price.

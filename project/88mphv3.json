It does so by pooling deposits with differing maturations and fixed-rates together and putting the funds in a yield-generating protocol, such as Compound, Aave, and yEarn, to earn floating-rate interest. The debt incurred by the promised fixed-rate interest of a deposit is offered as floating-rate bonds (or fundings as referred to in the contracts), which someone can purchase in exchange for the floating-rate interest generated by the corresponding deposit. Buyers of floating-rate bonds thus speculate on the floating-rate yield generated by the underlying protocol, while decreasing the debt of the pool and the risk of insolvency.\n\n88mph is interested in securing its V3 smart contracts and is primarily interested in preventing the loss of user funds, permanent impairment of the protocol state, or severe damage to the protocol state, in addition to any issue that might cause user dissatisfaction or minimal failure.

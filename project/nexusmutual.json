      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the\nfollowing types:\n\n**Smart Contracts/Blockchain:**\n\n- Re-entrancy\n- Logic errors\n  - including user authentication errors\n- Solidity/EVM details not considered\n  - including integer over-/under-flow\n  - including unhandled exceptions\n- Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n  - including composability vulnerabilities\n- Oracle failure/manipulation\n- Novel governance attacks\n- Economic/financial attacks\n  - including flash loan attacks\n- Congestion and scalability\n  - including running out of gas\n  - including block stuffing\n  - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n- Consensus failures\n- Cryptography problems\n  - Signature malleability\n  - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n  - Weak randomness\n  - Weak encryption\n- Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n- Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on\nthe <Link href=\"/severity-system/\">Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System</Link>. This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nPayouts are handled by __Nexus Mutual__ directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "**The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug\nbounty program:**\n\n- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Attacks that rely on social engineering\n- Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n\n**Smart Contracts/Blockchain**\n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n  - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity\n- Best practice critiques\n- Sybil attacks\n\n**The following activities are prohibited by bug bounty program:**\n\n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be\n  done on private testnets\n- Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees\n  and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser\n  extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Disassembly or reverse engineering of binaries for which source code is not\n  published, not including smart contract bytecode\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty",

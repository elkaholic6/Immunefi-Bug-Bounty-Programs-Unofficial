Because cryptocurrency wallets and digital asset ownership are part of the Gala Games experience, security is of utmost importance.\n\nFor more information about Gala Games entertainment ecosystem, please visit [https://gala.com/.](https://gala.com/)\n\nGala Games provides bounty rewards in __$GALA__. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC and KYT is required to receive a reward for this bug bounty program, where the following information will be required to be provided:\n- Identity Proof (Passport, / National ID).\n- Legitimacy of the wallet on which they would like to receive their bounty payment.\n\nKYC and KYT information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report and is mandatory to be eligible for a bug bounty payout.   \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nGala Games adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nGala Games adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward:\n- KYC blocked security researchers - Gala Games cannot pay bounties to individuals that take part in criminal or illegal activities. Therefore, Gala Games must perform KYC and wallet verification due to rules & regulations.\n- KYT blocked wallets - the identity of the individual must be verified as well as the legitimacy of the wallet on which they would like to receive their bounty payment due to rules & regulations.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart contract, Critical severity\n- Smart contract, High severity\n- Smart contract, Medium severity\n- Websites & applications, Critical severity\n- Websites & applications, High severity\n- Websites & applications, Medium severity\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the [Immunefi-wide PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Gala Games__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in __$GALA__. \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n",

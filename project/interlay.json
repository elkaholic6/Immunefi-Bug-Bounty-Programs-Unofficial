However, there is a minimum Critical reward of __USD 5 000__. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Audit reports: [https://github.com/interlay/interbtc/tree/master/docs/audits](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc/tree/master/docs/audits) \n  - Blockchain implementation issues: [https://github.com/interlay/interbtc/issues](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc/issues)\n  - Off-chain client issues: [https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-clients/issues](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-clients/issues) \n  - Security design limitations: [https://spec.interlay.io/security_performance/xclaim-security.html](https://spec.interlay.io/security_performance/xclaim-security.html) and [https://spec.interlay.io/security_performance/btcrelay-security.html](https://spec.interlay.io/security_performance/btcrelay-security.html) \n  - Economic design limitations: [https://spec.interlay.io/economics/incentives.html](https://spec.interlay.io/economics/incentives.html) \n\nFor more information regarding the documentation, please refer to:\n  - Official docs: [https://docs.interlay.io/#/](https://docs.interlay.io/#/) \n  - Development environments:\n    - [https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-api/#development](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-api/#development)\n    - [https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-clients#development](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-clients#development)\n    - [https://github.com/interlay/interbtc#testing](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc#testing)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Interlay__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

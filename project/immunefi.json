Primary areas of concern are around the modification of information on the website, leakage and loss of client data, and leakage of communicated information from clients to the company.\n\nImmunefi is aiming to decentralize the bug bounty space to provide more trust between whitehats and projects through releasing a smart contract Vaults System.\n\nThe first iteration of this Vaults System contains two features: 1) projects on Immunefi can demonstrate proof-of-assets by depositing assets into vaults that are ready to be used to pay out bounties, and 2) projects can conduct payments to whitehats fully on-chain within the Immunefi dashboard. \n\nPrimary areas of concern are the permanent modification of information on the application, leakage and loss of client data, and loss of assets in the vaults. \n",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC, and code is required.\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for the program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected, and Immunefi will provide proof that the issue is already known.  Previous audits of the Vaults System completed by Immunefi and External Auditors are linked below\n\n__Known Issues:__\n  - Here’s the [internal audit](https://github.com/immunefi-team/vaults/blob/main/audits/2023-02-03%20-%20Immunefi%20-%20Internal%20Audit%20of%20the%20Vaults%20system.pdf) PDF the Vault system \n  - Here’s the [Ourovoros audit](https://github.com/immunefi-team/vaults/blob/main/audits/2023-02-13%20-%20Ourovoros%20Audit.md) of the Vault system \n  - Any well-known issues related to Gnosis Safe: [https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/learn/security/security-audits](https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/learn/security/security-audits)\n\n__KYC__\n\nFor all submissions, Immunefi may request the researcher's country of residence before releasing payment. Some countries are restricted when it comes to payments. This bug bounty program is only open to individuals who reside outside of the countries that are restricted by OFAC and by UNSC resolutions.\n\nFor critical submissions, Immunefi will request government identification.

However, payouts are done in __USDC__. Sommelier commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a __Primacy of Impact__ program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact). \n\nSommelier __does__ have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\nSommelier will send a link to complete KYC through [Rise](https://pay.riseworks.io/auth/login) pay.  KYC will be anonymous to Sommelier.  \n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n- Mitigations against malicious strategists are still a work in progress and not eligible for a bug bounty at this time\n- Volumetric denial of service attacks against the gravity bridge via on chain txs are not fully mitigated against and not eligible for a bug bounty\n- Audits for smart contracts are in of the github repos: [https://github.com/PeggyJV/cellar-contracts/tree/main/audits](https://github.com/PeggyJV/cellar-contracts/tree/main/audits)\n",

Violation of these rules can result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the Immunefi platform at the sole discretion of the Immunefi team, which may also result in: 1) the forfeiture and loss of access to all bug submissions, and 2) zero payout. \n\nPlease note that Immunefi has no tolerance for spam/low-quality/incomplete bug reports, “beg bounty” behavior, and misrepresentation of assets and severity. Immunefi exists to protect the global crypto community, not facilitate grift.\n\nProhibited: \n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n- [Any other actions prohibited by the Immunefi Rules.](https://immunefi.com/rules/) These rules are subject to change at any time.  \n",

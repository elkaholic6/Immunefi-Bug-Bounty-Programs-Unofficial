The classification is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. For Morpho the “None” has been removed.\n\nThe likelihood can be asses with the following elements:\n  - Very Likely: no capital required, atomic attack, no assumptions to be made\n  - Likely: low capital required, simple attack, some low assumptions to be made\n  - Unlikely: high capital required, attack over several blocks, relying on strong assumptions\n  - Very Unlikely: very high capital required, attack over several blocks or  very complex to perform, relying on very strong assumptions\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\n__Critical\t\t\tUp to USD 555 555__\n\n|  |                |            |Severity                                        \n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | \n|        | Very Likely       | $5,000.00       | $15,000.00       | $100,000.00       | $555,555.00       | \n|        | Likely       | $1,000.00       | $5,000.00       | $15,000.00       | $100,000.00       | \n| Likelihood       | Unlikely        |  $0       | $1,000.00        | $5,000.00        |   $15,000.00      \n|        | Very Unlikely    | $0       | $0       |   $1,000.00| $5,000.00       |   \n|        |        | Low       | Medium       | High       | Critical       | \n\n__Websites and Applications__\n\n__Critical\t\t\t\t\tUSD 50 000__\n\n|  |                |            |Severity                                        \n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | \n|        | Very Likely       | $500.00       | $1,000.00       | $10,000.00       | $50,000.00       | \n|        | Likely       | $200.00       | $500.00       | $1,000.00       | $10,000.00       | \n| Likelihood       | Unlikely        |  $0       | $200.00        | $500.00        |   $1,000.00      \n|        | Very Unlikely    | $0       | $0       |   $200.00| $500.00       |   \n|        |        | Low       | Medium       | High       | Critical       |\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 55 555 for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nCurrent and past contractors with Morpho Labs or the Morpho Association are not eligible for any rewards from this bug bounty program. \n\nMorpho requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is a scan of a photo ID. Morpho will also request an invoice with your name, email address and crypto wallet address in order to payout the reward.\n\nThe following known issues are considered to be out of scope of this program: \n  - Rounding errors.\n  - COMP rewards can be claimed as part of the reserve factor if COMP is listed as market.\n  - Someone can repay on behalf of Morpho.\n  - Relatively high gas consumption.\n  - Extreme market turmoil vulnerability.\n  - Some contracts are not set yet (eg: IncentivesVault).\n  - Manipulation of the matching engine. Here are some examples:\n    - Split large amounts: On Morpho, pure supplier whales are always in the first positions of data structures and constantly matched/unmatched. What is possible to do is to supply a large amount with a first account. Borrow-repay (free), to match itself, and then withdraw enough from the supply  to be inserted in the FIFO part of the data structure. The final result is a huge liquidity matched splitted across multiple accounts. \n    - Flashloan to enter peer-to-peer: A user is waiting in the FIFO part of the pool data structure because larger users are placed before this user. With a flash loan, it’s possible to supply enough to become the first user waiting to be matched. Then borrow-repay (free), to match peer-to-peer the user itself as well as the second one. Then withdraw the flasloaned amount and end the tx. The user is thus matched peer-to-peer.\n\n  - All other issues acknowledged  in the audits in this repo: \n    [https://github.com/morpho-dao/morpho-v1/](https://github.com/morpho-dao/morpho-v1/) and [https://github.com/morpho-dao/morpho-aave-v3](https://github.com/morpho-dao/morpho-aave-v3)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Morpho Labs__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

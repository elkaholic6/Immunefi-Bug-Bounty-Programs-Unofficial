With it, anyone can easily launch a compliant dApp - or easily adapt an existing dApp on another chain to new regulations. As a result, there will be a perfect balance between user privacy, regulatory compliance, and decentralization.\n\nProgram is set to end on November 15, 2023\n\nFor more information about Swisstronik, please visit [https://swisstronik.com/  ](https://swisstronik.com/)\n\nSwisstronik is launching its first Testnet, which includes the blockchain with the Intel SGX integration, but excludes the second data security level (ZK-SNARKs) and the Identity module. Testnet 2.0 with more functionalities is planned for Q4 2023. Official audit is also slated for latter.\n\nSwisstronik provides rewards in USDT(TRC20). For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC is required to receive a reward for this bug bounty program where the following information will be required to be provided:\n\n- Email verification, photo/selfie, ID/Passport, country of residence & nationality\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nSwisstronik adheres to category 1. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication ](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/)page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nSwisstronik adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nSwisstronik commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Swisstronik will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nSwisstronik has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward.\n- US residents, citizens and/or holders of long-term residence/work permits etc\n- China residents, citizens and/or holders of long-term residence/work permits etc.\n- Individuals that are listed or associated with any person or entity listed on any of the US Department of Commerce’s denied persons or entity list, the US department of treasury’s specially designated nationals or blocked persons lists, the US Department of State’s debarred parties list, the EU Consolidated List of persons, groups and entities subject to EU financial sanctions or the Swiss SECO’s overall list of sanctioned individuals, entities and organizations or nationals as well as residents of, citizens of or located in geographic areas that is subject to UN-, US-, EU or Swiss sanctions or embargoes. \n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nAt Immunefi, we sometimes receive reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. If it’s obviously feasible, then it seems there are no questions about severity or payout amount. But if the bug report is less feasible, or not really feasible at all, suddenly questions arise.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what a Projects should or should not cite when downgrading a bug report’s impact, severity, and/or payout amount. These standards are continuously being developed and updated  with help of the community and encompasses fair guidelines where the project clearly commits, and the security researcher can be assured that the project cannot arbitrarily downgrade the program based on theoretical counter measures, such as a [chain rollback. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Blockchain/DLT: Critical\n- Blockchain/DLT: High\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Swisstronik team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDT (TRC20).\n",

This means that Swisstronik will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. </p><p><strong>Immunefi Standard Badge</strong></p><p>Swisstronik has satisfied the requirements for the <a href=\"https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-\">Immunefi Standard Badge</a>, which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.</p>",
